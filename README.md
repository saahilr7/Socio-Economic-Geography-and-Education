Statistical Data Mining Project


Executive Summary:

Our dataset contained information of math scores for students in the years 2013 through 2017. The observations were for each grade, districts and gender (of students) of middle school (grade 3 through 8) in the New York City public school system. 

Goal:
Our aim was to determine whether there was a notable difference in math test results for students in schools across different boroughs or districts in New York City. 

Analysis and Conclusion:
Once we cleaned and structured our dataset to answer our problem statement, we were able to start the statistical modeling and analysis on our dataset.

We expected to see a trend that mimicked the national trend of higher scores in wealthier districts but surprisingly, we found out that this was not the case. We could conclude that success in education depended on more complex factors and more specifically, the innate “ability” (currently almost immeasurable) of every individual to perform well in school.

In short, through the numerous models that we created on R and incorporating transforms, our final model showed no practical difference in math test scores for students who went to school that were spread out across different boroughs in New York City. Based on our findings we would not  find it appropriate for policy-makers to make a premature decision on education policy prior to more granular and definitive research being conducted.
