Statistical Data Mining Project


Executive Summary

	Our dataset contained information of math scores for students in the years 2013 through 2017. The observations were for each grade, districts and gender (of students) of middle school (grade 3 through 8) in the New York City public school system. Our aim was to determine whether there was a notable difference in math test results for students in schools across different boroughs or districts in New York City. Once we cleaned and structured our dataset to answer our problem statement, we were able to start the statistical modeling and analysis on our dataset. In short, through the numerous models that we created on R and incorporating transforms, our final model showed no practical difference in math test scores for students who went to school that were spread out across different boroughs in New York City. Based on our findings we would not  find it appropriate for policy-makers to make a premature decision on education policy prior to more granular and definitive research being conducted.
